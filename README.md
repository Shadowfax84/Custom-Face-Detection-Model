# **Custom Face Detection Model**  
This repository contains the necessary Jupyter notebooks for training a custom face detection model and using it to generate facial embeddings. This model serves as a precursor to **PrivifyAI** project, ensuring optimized performance for real-time face recognition.  

## **üìå Overview**  
This project consists of two key components:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Training a Custom Face Detection Model**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Using MobileNetV2 for Face Detection and Embedding Generation**
